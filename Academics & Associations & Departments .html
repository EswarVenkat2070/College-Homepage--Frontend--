Greetings.! Thank you for visiting our SVCE website for information.
<br><br>
Perhaps, you may be our prospective student, parent of a student, educationist, researcher or a citizen of the world. I hope that this site will provide all the College information that you are looking for. 
<br><br>
Well, the College started with a humble beginning, thirty-two years ago, with just three undergraduate programmes and has gradually grown up into a mammoth institution with ten undergraduate programmes, ten postgraduate programmes and eleven research programmes. The members of the faculty and the facilities in the College are superb. 
<br><br>
The Vision of the College is to develop the institution into a "CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE" by offering quality engineering education and research. 
<br><br>
In our College, students not only earn their degrees in various disciplines but also learn to acquire total personality, emphasize ethical values and prepare themselves to meet the growing challenges of the industry and diverse societal needs of our nation. 
<br><br>
The college has shown great progress in various engineering and technology researches. Faculty members and students have been involved in many research areas. External funding agencies such as AICTE, DRDO, DST, and TNSCST have sponsored some of our research projects. 
<br><br>
The facilities for the extracurricular activities are ample and modern to complement technical skills with valuable life skills. Thank you for choosing SVCE. An exciting learning experience awaits you. 
<br><br>
Welcome to SVCE.
